## ❓ Business Problem


### 🔑 Churn & Retention

  Q.1 Which subscription type has the highest churn rate?
→ Helps decide if pricing plans need redesign.

Q.2 What are the top regions with the highest churned customers?
→ Useful for region-specific marketing or retention offers.

Q.3 How does churn vary across different payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal, Crypto, Gift Card)?
→ Reveals if certain payment methods indicate unreliable customers.


## 📊 Customer Engagement

Q.4 What is the average watch_hours and avg_watch_time_per_day difference between churned vs retained users?
→ Shows if engagement predicts retention.

Q.5 Which devices (TV, Mobile, Tablet, etc.) are most commonly used by churned vs retained customers?
→ Useful for optimizing user experience on weaker platforms.

Q.6 Which favorite genres are most popular among retained customers vs churned customers?

Q.8 What is the average monthly fee paid by churned vs retained users?

## 👥 User Behavior & Profiles

Q.9 Does the number_of_profiles (1, 2, 5, etc.) affect churn likelihood?
→ Shows if family/household usage reduces churn.

Q.10 How does inactivity (last_login_days) correlate with churn probability?
